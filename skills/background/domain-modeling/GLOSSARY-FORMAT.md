# GLOSSARY.md Format

## Structure

```md
# {Context Name}

{One or two sentence description of what this context is and why it exists.}

## Language

**Order**:
{A one or two sentence description of the term}
_Avoid_: Purchase, transaction

**Invoice**:
A request for payment sent to a customer after delivery.
_Avoid_: Bill, payment request

**Customer**:
A person or organization that places orders.
_Avoid_: Client, buyer, account
```

## Rules

- **Be opinionated.** When multiple words exist for the same concept, pick the best one and list the others under `_Avoid_`.
- **Keep definitions tight.** One or two sentences max. Define what it IS, not what it does.
- **Only include terms specific to this project's context.** General programming concepts (timeouts, error types, utility patterns) stay out even when the project uses them extensively.
- **Group terms under subheadings** when natural clusters emerge.

## Context map

In a multi-context repo, the root `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` lists the contexts, where they live, and how they relate to each other:

```md
# Context Map

## Contexts

- [Ordering](./src/ordering/GLOSSARY.md): receives and tracks customer orders
- [Billing](./src/billing/GLOSSARY.md): generates invoices and processes payments
- [Fulfillment](./src/fulfillment/GLOSSARY.md): manages warehouse picking and shipping

## Relationships

- **Ordering → Fulfillment**: Ordering emits `OrderPlaced` events; Fulfillment consumes them to start picking
- **Fulfillment → Billing**: Fulfillment emits `ShipmentDispatched` events; Billing consumes them to generate invoices
- **Ordering ↔ Billing**: Shared types for `CustomerId` and `Money`
```
